# Economical Writing Principles

A comprehensive guide for evaluating student writing, derived from McCloskey's *Economical Writing* (2000).

## The Foundational Truth: Writing Is Thinking

You cannot split content from style. They are yolk and white in a scrambled egg. The production function for thinking cannot be written as the sum of two subfunctions, one producing "results" and the other "writing them up." You do not learn the details of an argument until writing it in detail, and in writing the details you uncover flaws in the fundamentals.

**Good thinking is:** accurate, symmetrical, relevant to the audience, concrete yet usefully abstract, concise yet usefully full, self-critical, and honest. **So too is good writing.**

The guiding question: **So What?** Answer that question in every sentence.

---

## The Golden Rule: Be Clear

Write so the reader **cannot possibly misunderstand** (Quintilian). Clarity is a social matter decided by the reader, not the writer. If a reader finds a passage unclear, it is unclear—quit arguing.

**Clarity is a matter of speed directed at the point.** Bad writing:
- Stops you with a puzzle in every other sentence
- Sends you off in irrelevant directions
- Provokes irritated questions about what the subject is now
- Makes you lose your way

**The test:** Glance at any passage. Whenever your reading pace is checked by some difficulty of expression, note the cause.

## Core Principles with Specific Instructions

### 1. Use Active Verbs

**Verbs make English.** Write with nouns and verbs, not adjectives and adverbs. In revision, adjectives and adverbs should be the first to go.

**The nominalization disease:** Find the action in a sentence and express it in a verb—not buried in a noun. "Nominalization" is expressing the action as a phrase functioning as a noun, which saps vigor.

| Nominalized (Weak) | Active (Strong) |
|---|---|
| "There is a data reanalysis need" | "We must reanalyze our data" |
| "An increase in prices occurred" | "Prices increased" |
| "The implementation of the policy" | "They implemented the policy" |
| "There is a need for analysis" | "We must analyze" |

**The test:** Circle every "is" in the writing. If the page looks like a bad case of acne, replace "is" with real action verbs.

**"There is" and "It is" often cause problems.** Notice that a real verb requires a real subject—there's no place to hide. Nominalization is popular among bureaucrats because it frees them from personal responsibility.

**The passive voice hides the actor.** Not "active verbs should be used" (cowardice) but "you should use active verbs." The imperative is a good substitute: "divide both sides by x" instead of "both sides are then divided by x."

---

### 2. Be Concrete

**A good general rule: Be Concrete.** A singular word is more concrete than a plural. Definiteness is concrete.

**Prefer:** Pepperidge Farm → bread → widgets → X

Readers translate examples up into principles more easily than they translate abstractions down into examples. Much economic writing reads like a code.

| Abstract (Code) | Concrete (Clear) |
|---|---|
| "capital and labor" | "machines and men" |
| "natural resource-oriented exports" | "sheep and wheat" |
| "the commencement of the Spanish Price Revolution antedated the inflow of treasure" | "Spanish prices began to rise before the treasure came" |
| "Consider two cities, A and B, trading an asset, X" | "New York and London both had markets for Union Pacific bonds" |

Bad writers use abstraction because they have nothing to say and don't want the fact to become too plain. They also use it to "get general"—but readers can generalize from concrete examples themselves.

---

### 3. Be Plain

**Anglo-Saxon words have acquired concreteness through homely use that Latinate words lack.**

| Latinate/Fancy | Plain English |
|---|---|
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "implement" | "do" or "carry out" |
| "the integrative consequences of growing structural differentiation" | "the need for others when you buy rather than bake your bread" |
| "geographical and cultural factors function to spatially confine growth to specific regions for long periods of time" | "once a place gets poor it stays poor" |
| "current period responses" | "what people do now" |
| "complex lagged effects" | "the many things they do later" |
| "interim variation" | "change" |

**Five-dollar words hide five-cent thoughts.** Economists would think more clearly if they recognized a simple thought for what it is. The "time inconsistency problem" is the economics of changing one's mind. The "principal/agent problem" is the economics of what hirelings do.

**The pose is pathetic:** Science and scholarship depend on the quality of argument, not on the level of diction. It's not difficult to explain complex ideas in plain words to smart people willing to pay attention.

---

### 4. Untie the Teutonisms

**Teutonisms are noun pile-ups** like "factor price equalization" or "private wealth-seeking activity." German invents words like these; English does not suit them.

**The test:** Untie the knot by adding "of":

| Teutonic Knot | Untied |
|---|---|
| "factor price equalization" | "the equalization of the prices of factors" |
| "private wealth-seeking activity" | "the activity of seeking wealth privately" → then simplify: "seeking wealth" |
| "long-run balance of payments adjustment" | "adjustment of the balance of payments in the long run" |
| "elastic credit supply expectations rise" | (Requires complete rewrite—who knows which word modifies which?) |

**Examples of knots the reader must stop to untie:**
- "anti-quantity theory evidence"
- "contractually uniform transaction cost"
- "initial relative capital goods price shock"
- "community decision making process"
- "Cobb-Douglas production function estimation approach"

**The possessive is a teutonism generator.** "The standard economist's model"—what's standard, the model or the economist? Unless attached to a proper noun (Samuelson's genius), avoid it.

**Query any phrase with more than one adjective.** Watch especially for nouns used as adjectives piling up teutonically.

---

### 5. Delete Ruthlessly

**Sydney Smith (c. 1830):** "Run your pen through every other word you have written; you have no idea what vigour it will give to your style."

Smith's own sentence, edited:
- Original: "In composing, as a general rule, run your pen through every other word you have written; you have no idea what vigour it will give to your style."
- Edited: "Run your pen through every other word; you have no idea what vigour it will give."

**Adjectives and adverbs should be the first to go.** Most "very"s, "absolutely"s, "basically"s, "actually"s add nothing. Adverbs often convey your opinion, which only your mother cares about.

**Tone is transmitted by adverbs** (those "-ly" words). Run your pen through each "very." Most things aren't very. "Absolutely," "purely," and the like claim too much. "Literally" is routinely misused to mean "Wow, I really feel this strongly!!" Screaming is not speaking well.

---

### 6. Express Parallel Ideas in Parallel Form (Avoid Elegant Variation)

**Use one word to mean one thing.** Get your words and things lined up and keep them that way.

**The positive rule (Strunk and White):** Express parallel ideas in parallel form.
**The negative rule (Fowler):** Avoid Elegant Variation.

**Elegant Variation uses many words to mean one thing,** with the result that the reader—and even the writer—don't quite know what is being talked about.

**Bad example from one paper:** "industrialization," "growing structural differentiation," "economic and social development," "social and economic development," "development," "economic growth," "growth," and "revolutionized means of production"—all meaning the same thing.

**Another example:** "the indifferent harvests of 1815 and calamitous volume deficiencies of 1816"—both mean bad crops.

**Notice:** Elegant Variation often comes draped in five-dollar words. "Growing structural differentiation" = new jobs in manufacturing. "Calamitous volume deficiencies" = very bad crops.

**Yet avoid pointless repetition.** "It is a place where work gets done. The new plan gets done by setting a new agenda." The two "gets done" mean different things—confusing. But don't vary words just to please Miss Jones.

---

### 7. Make Your Writing Cohere

**The Rule of Coherence:** Make writing hang together. The reader can understand writing that hangs together. She can't understand writing filled with irrelevancies.

**How coherence works:** Each sentence is linked to the previous one through repetition of key words. In a coherent paragraph:
- (AB)(BC)(CD) looks pretty, is easy to understand, is probably reasonable
- (ABZYX)(MNOP)(BJKLC) looks ugly, is impossible to understand, is probably nonsense

**A newspaper editor's advice:** "It doesn't much matter what your first sentence is. It doesn't even much matter what the second is. But the third damn well better follow from the first and second."

**English achieves coherence by repetition, not by signal.** You must violate the schoolmarm's rule of not repeating words. Repeat them, linking sentences. Use pronouns like "it" or "them" to relieve monotony. Repeat words with the same root in different forms (polyptoton).

**DO NOT achieve coherence by clunky traffic signals.** A clumsy way begins each sentence with a linking word: "Indeed... However... Therefore... Furthermore... To be sure... But on the other hand..."

You tire of being pushed around, told when to take a sentence illustratively ("indeed"), adversatively ("yet," "however," "but"), sequentially ("furthermore," "therefore"), or concessively ("to be sure"). You are crushed by clanking machinery such as the hideous "not only... but also."

**Repeat, and your paragraphs will cohere.**

---

### 8. Put Important Things at the End

**The most important rule of sentence arrangement: The end of the sentence is the place of emphasis.** The reader leaves the sentence with the last word ringing in her ears.

| Weak Ending | Strong Ending |
|---|---|
| "The end of the sentence is the emphatic location" | "The end of the sentence is the place of emphasis" |
| "That putting trivial things at the end will weaken the sentence is a corollary of the rule" | "A corollary of the rule is that putting trivial things at the end will weaken the sentence" |

**First in emphasis: the end. Second: the beginning. Dump less important things in the middle, or in the trash.**

**Avoid straggling sentences:** Adding one more idea at the last minute causes straggling. The limerick:
> That foolish young man of Japan,
> Whose limericks never would scan.
> When asked why it was
> He replied, "It's because
> I always try to get as much into the last line as I ever possibly can."

**Doublets and triplets:** Shift the longest portion to the end.
- "Keynes and the Keynesians" works; "The Keynesians and Keynes" does not
- "Faith, hope, and charity" works; "Charity, faith, and hope" does not

---

### 9. Follow Gardner's Rule for Sentence Rhythm

**John Gardner's advice:** An English sentence has three grammatical parts: subject, verb, object. Vary your sentences by how much you put into each, and **in each sentence choose only one of the three parts for elaboration.**

A sentence with too much in all three parts exhausts and confuses the reader. Notice that you stop paying attention halfway through such sentences.

**Listen for monotony:** If every sentence is the same length and construction, the paragraph becomes monotonous. If you have some dramatic reason for repeating the construction, fine. If not, the reader feels misled.

---

### 10. Avoid Boilerplate

**Boilerplate is all that is prefabricated and predictable.** It bores readers.

**Never start a paper with "This paper..."** That all-purpose filler for the bankrupt imagination bores the reader, whose impulse is to give up.

**Better:** Take the reader from where he presumably stands in point of knowledge and bring him to the matter under review. "Every economist knows by now that monopoly does not much reduce income. Every economist appears to be mistaken."

**The table-of-contents paragraph kills momentum:** "The outline of this paper is as follows." Don't, please, please, for God's sake, don't. Nine out of ten readers skip to the substance. The few who pause are wasting their time—they can't understand the paragraph until they've read the paper, at which point they don't need it.

**The Jonesian rule ("Say what you're going to say; say it; say that you've said it") has nearly ruined economic prose.** Papers consist mostly of summary, outline, anticipation, announcement, redundancy, and review. They never get to the point. The person who made up this memorable phrasing is burning right now in Hell.

**"Background" is padding**—material you collected that you later discovered was beside the point. It seems a shame not to use it. Resist. No one will be fooled.

**Never repeat without apologizing:** ("as I said earlier"; or merely "again"). Unless you apologize, the reader thinks you have not noticed the repetition and will suspect you haven't thought through the organization. She'll be right.

---

### 11. Control Your Tone—Overcome the Academic Pose

**Tone depends on choosing and keeping an appropriate implied author:** the Enthusiastic Student, the Earnest Scientist, the Reasonable Journeyman, the Professor. The successful piece has an author the reader can tolerate.

**What spoils academic writing is lack of confidence.** C. Wright Mills: "Such lack of ready intelligibility usually has little to do with the complexity of subject matter, and nothing at all with profundity of thought. It has to do almost entirely with certain confusions of the academic writer about his own status... Desire for status is one reason why academic men slip so readily into unintelligibility... To overcome the academic prose you have first to overcome the academic pose."

**Three questions to clarify:**
1. How difficult and complex after all is my subject?
2. When I write, what status am I claiming for myself?
3. For whom am I trying to write?

**Decide to be understood and worry some other time about being admired.** Do not try to impress people who already understand the argument (they will not be amused). Try to explain it in a reasonable tone to people who do not now understand.

**Be nice, not servile or pompous.** Students would do better to reveal more of their character in their writing. Take off the mask of The Scientist.

**The worst mistake is to be unpleasant.** If you yell at people they will walk away. Avoid invective: "This is pure nonsense"; "there is absolutely no evidence for this view"; "the hypothesis is fanciful" arouse the suspicion that the argument needs passion to overcome its weakness. Indignation against That Idiot arouses sympathy for That Idiot.

**Keep your opinions pretty much to yourself.** "To air one's views gratuitously is to imply that the demand for them is brisk."

**Humor helps.** There is nothing unscientific in self-deprecating jokes. Only third-rate scholars are so worried about the academic pose that they insist on their dignity.

### 12. Tables, Graphs, and Equations Are Writing Too

The wretched tables and graphs in economics show how little economists care about expression. **The usual rules of writing apply.**

**For tables:**
- Ask: "Is this entry necessary? Would I dribble on in similar way in prose?"
- No reader wants annual figures 1900-1980 when the issue is growth over the span
- Give statistics in the simplest form consistent with their use
- Eight decimal places are not ordinarily of any use
- Use words in headings, not computer acronyms ("LPDOM" requires translation to "Logarithm of Domestic Price")

**For graphs:**
- Use titles that state the theme: "All Conferences Should Happen in the Midwest" instead of "A Model of Transport Costs"
- Use meaningful, spelled-out names for lines, points, areas: "Rich Budget Line" instead of "Locus QuERtY"

**For displayed equations:**
- "Quantity of Grain = 3.56 + 5.6(Price of Grain) - 3.8(Real Income)" is clearer than "Q = 3.56 + 5.6P - 3.8Y, where Q is quantity of grain, P its price, and Y real income"
- Anyone can retrieve the algebra from the words; the reverse is pointlessly harder
- Even expert mathematicians do not think in symbols

---

### 13. Avoid Cheap Typographical Tricks

**Acronyms pimple the page.** An occasional GDP won't hurt, but even GDCF pains all but the hardened accountant. "Capital formation" or plain "it" will do. The absurd justification of "saving space" saves only a half dozen lines.

**Use italics and quotation marks sparingly.** They add Breathlessness or Solemnity or Coyness. If you use italics to make your point clear, it's probably because the sentence is badly set up to give emphasis naturally—fix it. If you use "quotation marks" all the time when not actually quoting, you probably wish to apologize for the wrong word or to sneer at it. Don't. It's impolite to cringe or sneer.

---

### 14. Query Every "This," "That," "These," "Those"

**Circle the "this" and "these" in your draft.** You'll be surprised at their number.

"This" points the reader back to the thing referred to, for no good reason. No writer wants her reader to look back—looking back is looking away, interrupting forward flow.

**Often the plain "the" will do fine** and keep the reader reading. Or repeat the word represented by "this." Repetition brings clarity.

**The rule:** Query every "this" or "these." Take most of them out.

---

### 15. Check Punctuation by Ear

**The comma:** Weak writers use too many commas, by rule rather than by ear.

- It's no rule that "an if-clause always requires a comma after it"
- Rule-driven commas end up separating subject from verb
- **The trick:** In revision, delete most commas before "the"—"the" signals a new phrase well enough without the clunk
- Punctuate by ear: insert a comma where the pause in speaking seems to want it or where you get lost without it

**The comma splice is a grade-school error:** "The citizens lived in fear, the result was poor economic growth." If both clauses could stand alone as sentences, you need a period, semicolon, colon, or conjunction.

**Colon vs. semicolon:**
- Colon (:) means "to be specific"—an illustration follows
- Semicolon (;) means "furthermore"—a parallel remark follows

---

### 16. Check for Dead Metaphors and Literal Impossibilities

English is jammed with dead metaphors, easily brought to life with incongruous effect.

**Look at what you have written: are the words literally possible?**

| Dead/Impossible | The Problem |
|---|---|
| "The indicators influenced the controls" | How does an indicator influence a control? |
| "The severity of the models" | Punishments can be severe; models cannot |

Good writers examine their words for literal meaning, to make sure metaphors remain dead or are brought to life decorously.

**Flee the cliche when a more original word is precise and vivid.** Consider "the pursuit of profit"—alternatives: seeking, finding, having, uncovering, coming upon, bumping into profit; pursuing gain, wealth, opportunities, satisfaction, success.

---

### 17. The Test: Read Out Loud

**Reading out loud is a powerful technique of revision.** You hear your writing as others hear it internally.

**The rule:** Don't write anything you would be embarrassed to read out loud to the intended audience.

**Hemingway:** "The writer needs a built-in, shockproof bullshit detector."

If in rereading out loud you blush to hear an over-fancy sentence or a jargony word, change it. You know more about good taste than you think.

## For Graders: Evaluating Student Writing

### Strengths to Praise (with specific observations)
- **Active verbs driving the prose:** "The author writes 'GDP grew 3.2%' rather than 'GDP growth of 3.2% was observed'"
- **Concrete examples illuminating abstract concepts:** "You ground the discussion of countercyclical spending in specific programs—unemployment insurance, food stamps—rather than leaving it abstract"
- **Plain language explaining complex ideas:** "Your explanation of purchasing power parity would be clear to a smart non-economist"
- **Natural voice:** "This reads like a confident person explaining, not a bureaucrat filing a report"
- **Coherent paragraphs:** "Each sentence follows from the previous one; you repeat key terms rather than using elegant variation"

### Issues to Address (with teaching-focused explanations)

**Nominalization:**
- "You write 'there was a decrease in employment.' Find the actor and the action: Who decreased employment? What did they do? 'Employers laid off workers' or 'Employment fell' puts the action in the verb where it belongs."

**Passive voice:**
- "You write 'prices were increased by the Fed.' The passive obscures who did what. 'The Fed raised prices' is clearer and shorter."

**Elegant variation:**
- "You call it 'the healthcare sector,' then 'the medical industry,' then 'health services.' The reader wonders: are these different things? Pick one term and stick with it."

**Boilerplate:**
- "The first two paragraphs summarize what you're going to say. Start with your most interesting finding instead."
- "'This paper discusses...' is the all-purpose filler for the bankrupt imagination. Hook the reader: What's surprising about your findings?"

**Abstract language:**
- "You write about 'capital and labor inputs.' What are the actual inputs? Machines and workers? Factories and employees? The concrete version is easier for readers to visualize."

**Teutonisms:**
- "'Long-run balance of payments adjustment' makes the reader untie a knot. 'Adjustment of the balance of payments in the long run' is clearer, if longer."

**Traffic signals:**
- "Every paragraph starts with 'Furthermore,' 'However,' 'Therefore,' or 'Indeed.' English achieves coherence by repetition, not by signal. Repeat key words instead."

**The academic pose:**
- "The jargon suggests you're trying to sound impressive rather than communicate clearly. What spoils academic writing is lack of confidence. You understand this material—write as if you're explaining it to a smart friend."

### Why It Matters (for feedback)

- **"Unclear writing suggests unclear thinking."** Employers, clients, and colleagues will assume that if you can't explain it clearly, you don't understand it.

- **"Readers who stumble stop reading."** Bad writing is not read, even by professors paid to read it. You have to be read to be listened to.

- **"Plain language demonstrates confidence."** Using jargon suggests you're hiding behind it. Using plain words shows you actually understand the material well enough to explain it simply.

- **"The goal is communication, not display."** The eighth grade is over. Writing is not a chance for empty display—it's a chance to make someone understand something.
